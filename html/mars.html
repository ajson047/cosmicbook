        <h2>About Mars</h2>
        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet 
          in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars 
          carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
          "Red Planet" because of the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on its surface. 
          Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface 
          features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys,
          deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
          Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known 
          mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons 
          in the Solar System. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are 
          thought to be captured asteroids.

              The largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris is four 
              times deeper than the Grand Canyon and stretches for over 2,000 miles. 
              It's an incredible sight to behold, and I would love to explore its vast 
              chasms and towering cliffs.
